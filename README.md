## 🧱 My Implementation Approach

I structured the app with a modular architecture to maintain scalability and readability.
I used `Bloc` for predictable and testable state management, and `GetIt` for clean dependency injection.
The API layer is built with `Dio` and `Retrofit` to simplify HTTP requests. 
Firebase handles authentication with user sessions to provide a personalized experience. Design-wise,
I focused on a cinematic, visually appealing UI that matches the theme of the app while ensuring responsiveness using `ScreenUtil`. 
Every screen is broken down into reusable widgets to keep the UI consistent and easy to manage.
